      <h2>A woman moves the world</h2>

          Bertha Benz was a German automotive pioneer. She was the business partner and wife of automobile inventor Karl
          Benz.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 5 August 1888, she was the first person to drive an automobile over a long distance, rigorously field
          testing the patent Motorwagen, inventing brake pads and solving several practical issues during the 65 miles
          (105 km) trip. In doing so, she brought the Benz Patent-Motorwagen worldwide attention and got the company its
          first sales.

        <h3>The Patent Motor Car</h3>
        <p>
          In 1886, Benz presented the Patent-Motorwagen automobile to the world. Within the decade, 25 vehicles had been
          built. With cutting-edge bicycle constructions, the Model I was the original Patent Motor Car and the world's
          first automobile.

            The Benz Patent-Motorwagen ("patent motorcar"), built in 1885, is widely regarded as the world's first
            production automobile.

        <p>The Model II was converted to a four-wheeler for test purposes, making it the only one of this model.</p>
        <p>
          The first Patent Motor Car sold in small production runs was the Model III. It had powered rear wheels with a
          ringed steel and solid rubber, steerable front wheel. Various options from which to choose were provided for
          customers, such as seat arrangements and a folding top.
        </p>
        <h3>First cross-country automobile journey</h3>
        <p>
          On 5 August 1888, 39-year-old Bertha Benz drove from Mannheim to Pforzheim with her sons Richard and Eugen,
          thirteen and fifteen years old respectively, in a Model III, without telling her husband and without
          permission of the authorities, thus becoming the first person to drive an automobile a significant distance,
          though illegally. Before this historic trip, motorized drives were merely very short trials, returning to the
          point of origin, made with assistance of mechanics. Following wagon tracks, this pioneering tour covered a
          one-way distance of about 106 km (66 mi).

          Although the ostensible purpose of the trip was to visit her mother, Bertha Benz had other motives — to prove
          to her husband, who had failed to adequately consider marketing his invention, that the automobile in which
          they both had heavily invested would become a financial success once it was shown to be useful to the general
          public; and to give her husband the confidence that his constructions had a future.
        </p>
        <p>
          She left Mannheim around dawn, solving numerous problems along the way. Bertha demonstrated her significant
          technical capabilities on this journey. With no fuel tank and only a 4.5-litre supply of petrol in the
          carburetor, she had to find ligroin, the petroleum solvent needed for the car to run. It was only available at
          apothecary shops, so she stopped in Wiesloch at the city pharmacy to purchase the fuel. At the time, petrol
          and other fuels could only be bought from chemists, and so this is how the chemist in Wiesloch became the
          first fuel station in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          She cleaned a blocked fuel line with her hat pin and used her garter as insulation material. A blacksmith had
          to help mend a chain at one point. When the wooden brakes began to fail, Benz visited a cobbler to install
          leather, making the world's first pair of brake pads. An evaporative cooling system was employed to cool the
          engine, making water supply a big worry along the trip. The trio added water to their supply every time they
          stopped. The car's two gears were not enough to surmount uphill inclines and Eugen and Richard often had to
          push the vehicle up steep roads. Benz reached Pforzheim somewhat after dusk, notifying her husband of her
          successful journey by telegram. She drove back to Mannheim several days later.

          Karl and Bertha Benz 1925 — Zenodot Verlagsges. mbH The novel trip received a great deal of publicity, as she
          had sought. The drive was a key event in the technical development of the automobile. The pioneering couple
          introduced several improvements after Bertha's experiences. She reported everything that had happened along
          the way and made important suggestions, such as the introduction of an additional gear for climbing hills and
          brake linings to improve brake-power. Her trip proved to the burgeoning automotive industry that test drives
          were essential to their business.
